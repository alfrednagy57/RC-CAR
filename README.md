# RC-Car Embedded System Project

## Overview
The RC-Car Embedded System Project represents the efforts in designing and developing a remote-controlled car using the ATmega32 microcontroller. This project combines fundamental principles of electronics, programming, and mechanical engineering to create a functional and educational prototype. The primary objective is to demonstrate the integration of various hardware and software components to achieve remote control functionality via a mobile app.


## Abstract
The RC-Car project involves creating a remote-controlled car that can be operated wirelessly using a mobile app. Key features include Bluetooth communication for wireless control, motor control using PWM techniques, and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. This project emphasizes hands-on learning in embedded systems through iterative design, programming, and testing phases.
